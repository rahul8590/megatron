\title{Megatron Writeup}
\author{Ted Smith and Rahul Ram}

\maketitle

Megatron is a source-to-source rewriter that adds profiling
instrumentation to Javascript programs.  
Megatron is based around a general framework for Javascript
manipulation using a visitor pattern.

\section{Implementation}

Megatron contains three main components:

\begin{itemize}
\item visit.js, a framework for transforming Javascript ASTs
\item rewrite.js, a client of visit.js that converts javascript to
  profiled javascript
\item runtime.js, a small library embedded in the output of rewrite.js
  that contains various functions related to profiling.
\end{itemize}

Megatron's rewriter is implemented as four passes over the AST.

The first pass stores the names of all declared functions for later
use.

The second pass rewrites every function and function expression to
return an object with three fields: ``megatron_func_id'',
``megatron_ret'', and ``megatron_this''. The first is used to build a
call graph that resolves calls to the same function via different
identifiers as a result of dynamism. The second is the original return
value of the function. The third is the ``this'' construct, which is
returned in the event the function invocation occurred inside a
``new'' expression.

The third pass rewrites every function call to an invocation of the
Megatron runtime function ``log_call''. ``log_call'' is passed two
strings representing the caller and callee function, a thunk that will
return the value of the call, and a boolean that is true if
``log_call'' is wrapping an invocation of ``new''. ``log_call''
Functions invoked by ``new'' implicitly return the ``this'' object, so
Megatron must override its default behavior and return ``this'' rather
than the return value of the constructor function, which is usually
``undefined''. ``log_call'' also takes the ``this'' object as a
parameter. Without explicitly passing ``this'', Megatron would
evaluate the thunk in the global ``this'' environment, causing
programs to execute incorrectly.
